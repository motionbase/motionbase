MotionBase is a course authoring platform. Courses are called topics; each topic
has chapters, and each chapter has sections. A section is one page of content.

Every tool acts as the authenticated user and only ever sees that user's own
courses. Start with list_topics, then get_topic for the outline, then
get_section to read a page.

# Block types

A section is a list of Editor.js blocks. Five of them are written as Markdown
through create_section and update_section:

  header      ## / ### / ####   Only levels 2-4 exist. Do NOT open a section
                                with a heading repeating its own title - the
                                title is already rendered above the body. Use
                                ### for subheadings; they also fill the page's
                                table of contents, so give every section one.
  paragraph   plain text        **bold**, *italic*, `code`, [links](url).
  list        - item / 1. item  Unordered and ordered.
  code        ``` fences        Put the language after the fence: ```css
  table       | a | b |         GFM pipe table. The first row is the header and
              | - | - |         the separator row is required. Cells may
              | 1 | 2 |         contain **bold**, *italic* and `code`.

The other six are placed by their own tool:

  interactive   create_interactive stores the HTML, add_interactive_block
                places it. See /design for the house style.
  quiz          add_quiz_block. Multiple choice, single answer, exactly one
                option correct. Answers are shuffled per learner, so never
                write one that refers to its own position.
  alert         add_alert_block. info / warning / danger / neutral.
  youtube       add_youtube_block. Any YouTube URL or a bare video id.
  image         list_media to find the id, then add_image_block.
  lottie        list_media to find the id, then add_lottie_block.

Files are uploaded in the web editor; this server places them but does not
accept uploads.

get_section renders those six as "> [...]" placeholders in the body and lists
them under rich_blocks with their full data, so anything removed can be put
back.

# Editing and removing

remove_block and move_block address a block by its index and work on every
type - that is how a single alert or graphic is deleted or reordered without
touching the rest. A Markdown block is edited by rewriting the body; the other
six are replaced by removing and adding them again.

# Overwriting

update_section with markdown replaces the ENTIRE body. Everything that is not
one of the five Markdown-backed types is lost, and the tool reports what it
removed in dropped_rich_blocks. If you only want one block gone, use
remove_block instead. When you do overwrite, read the section first and put the
rich blocks back from the data in rich_blocks.

delete_content removes a section, a chapter with its sections, or a topic with
everything under it, and wants the exact title as confirmation. It is not
reversible in one call - unpublishing is usually what is actually wanted.
